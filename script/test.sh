# This script runs a test series, of the project
# See this script like a BDD test, but you still have to check,
# visually if the results are correct by seeing outputs givem by
# Scheduler at terminal
#
# OBS: It is highly recommended, set the debug
# print flag to 0 (Print no debug messages).
#
# OBS2: This script don't compile the programs
# make sure you have compiled every one, before continue
#
# OBS3: RUN THIS SCRIPT AT SAME PLACE OF THE EXECUTABLES


# Control variables
# TODO - se alguem conseguir ai, coloque aqui por favor controle de path
# (substituindo a necessidade de rodar isso junto aos execut√°veis)
# E colocar uma variavel para controle dos testes de argumento,
# e controle de quais topologias seram testadas via array, while sei la,
# executando os mesmo testes para todas as topologias demandadas
